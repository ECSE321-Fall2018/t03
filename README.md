When the user opens the application, the user will be brought to a main menu. In the main menu, a user can sign-up/sign-in as a driver, a passenger. An admin can view all the data from the database. You will also be able to rate a user.

If the user clicks on the driver button, the user will be brought to the "create driver" page. The user can sign up as a driver. There are three fields to be filled out: Username, Password, Email. Once these fields are filled, the user should click the "Sign in/ Sign up". This will create a driver in the database, and bring you to a page that can allow the driver to create a route. In this page, the user will fill out the following fields: Price, Date, Start and End City, number of seats. Click the "create route" button to add the route to the database. You will then be brought to a page that says "thank you for using the ridesharing app."

If the user clicks on the passenger button, the user will be brought to the "create passenger" page. The user can sign up/sign in as a driver. There are two fields to be filled out: Username and Password. Once these fields are filled, the user should click the "Sign in/ Sign up" button. This will create a passenger in the database, and bring you to a page that can allow the passenger to sign up for a route. In this page, the user will fill out the following fields: Price, Date, Start and End City. Click the "join route" button to add the route to the database. You will then be brought to a page that says "You have succesfully joined the ride."

If the user clicks on the admin button, the user will be brought to a page that can allow the admin to view all the drivers and passengers in the system. The admin does not need to sign up.

If you click the rate user button, it will bring the user to a page where the user can rate a user by filling in the username field, and give it a rating out of 5.
